      <description>Launch Longhorn at the previous version. Launch a pod with Longhorn volume. Write data to the volume and take the 1st backup. Create 2 DR volumes from the 1st backup. Shutdown the pod and wait for the original volume detached. Expand the original volume and wait for the expansion complete. Write data to the original volume and take the 2nd backup. (Make sure the total data size is larger than the original volume size so that there is date written to the expanded part.</description>

      <description>Prepare 2 k8s clusters: cluster A and cluster B. Install previous version of Longhorn which doesn&amp;rsquo;t include this fix e.g v1.3.1, v1.2.5 on cluster A. Install the release version of Longhorn on cluster B. Set the same backup target on both cluster A and cluster B. Create volume, write some data, and take backup on cluster A. Wait for backup target polling update on cluster B. Make sure the backup created by cluster A can be pulled on cluster B.</description>

Create a volume and write data in the 1st cluster. Then create 1st backup. Restore the backup as a DR volume in the 2nd cluster. Modify the backup poll interval to a large value. Write more data for the volume in the 1st cluster, and create the 2nd backup. Activate the DR volume in the 2nd cluster.</description>
