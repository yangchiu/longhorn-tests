      <description>Note: Enabling Delete Empty Dir Data is mandatory to drain a node if a pod is associated with any storage.
Test with Longhorn default setting of &amp;lsquo;Node Drain Policy&amp;rsquo;: block-if-contains-last-replica 1. Drain operation on single node using Rancher UI Given Single node (1 Worker) cluster with Longhorn installed
AND few RWO and RWX volumes attached with node/pod exists
AND 1 RWO and 1 RWX volumes unattached
When Drain the node with default values of Rancher UI</description>
